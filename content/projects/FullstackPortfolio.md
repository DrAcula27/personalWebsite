Full Stack web app built using vanilla HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Nodejs. The client makes API calls to the server, which then makes external API calls to Lorem Picsum to get random photos. Once the URLs come back, the server sends them to the client, which finally sets it as the image source. A 'back to the basics' project to re-familiarize with the core technologies behind web dev frameworks. Hosted on Render.
