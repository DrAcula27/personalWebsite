              Hello! My name is Danielle and I enjoy creating things that live on the internet. I am
              a software engineer with 5+ years of experience in end-to-end full-stack development
              across a variety of industries, including startups and open-source projects. My career
              began in mechanical engineering and aviation maintenance, where I gained 7 years of
              combined experience in both military and engineering leadership. I thrive in
              collaborative, mission-driven environments where I can build secure, scalable
              solutions, and I'm excited about opportunities to create impactful, user-centered
              software. More than just being a leader, however, I am also a doer -
            </p>
            <p>On the frontend, I can:</p>
            <ul className="skills-list">
              <li>manage state with React Context</li>
              <li>build reusable UI components with React (and vanilla HTML)</li>
              <li>create responsive layouts that work across different screen sizes</li>
              <li>optimize rendering with memoization (React.memo, useMemo, useCallback)</li>
              <li>implement WCAG-compliance for screen readers and keyboard navigation</li>
              <li>
                Style applications using vanilla CSS or CSS frameworks like Bootstrap, Material UI,
                or Tailwind CSS
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>On the backend, I can:</p>
            <ul className="skills-list">
              <li>build out RESTful and GraphQL APIs</li>
              <li>manage SQL (PostgreSQL) and NoSQL (MongoDB) databases</li>
              <li>implement secure auth with JWT, OAuth, and session-based auth</li>
              <li>use CDNs and database caching to improve performance</li>
              <li>set up GitHub Actions</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              Currently, my main focus is building accessible, inclusive products and digital
              experiences as a <a href="#jobs">consultant</a> for a variety of clients.
            </p>

            <p>
              I actively contribute to <a href="https://www.hackforla.org">open source projects</a>{' '}
              and volunteer at local businesses in my free time.

          <p>
            I am a software engineer with a background in mechanical engineering, aviation
            maintenance, and salmon conservation. Currently, I consult as a web developer,
            contribute to multiple open-source/volunteer projects, and volunteer with my local
            salmon conservation group. After high school, I went to college to study aerospace and
            mechanical engineering. While in college, I joined the United States Marine Corps as a
            helicopter mechanic and worked part-time as a mechanical engineer to pay my way through
            school. I graduated from college with a bachelor of science in mechanical engineering,
            minors in aerospace engineering and German, and Magna Cum Laude honors. While working as
            a mechanical engineer, I found myself spending more time automating tasks to make my job
            more efficient (both for myself and my coworkers); I also found that I enjoyed that part
            of the job more than the engineering itself. Then COVID hit, and I lost my job.
            Motivated by my passion of automating tasks, I turned to software engineering. Since
            then, I started consulting web development work. As a consulting software engineer, I
            have completed projects for several clients, ranging from local government to Edtech
            startups. I continually upskill my technical and soft skills through the 100devs agency.
